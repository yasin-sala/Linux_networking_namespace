For routing packets from one subnet to another:

1. Enable IP forwading: IP forwarding allows the Linux kernel to forward packets between different network interfaces.

This can be done by modifying the '/etc/sysctl.conf' file and adding the following line:
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
Or simplly type "sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" in CLI

2. Add routing rules to the root namespace using the following lines:

# Route packets from node1 (172.0.0.2/24) to node3 (10.10.0.2/24)
ip route add 10.10.0.0/24 via 172.0.0.3 dev br1
# Route packets from node3 (10.10.0.2/24) to node1 (172.0.0.2/24)
ip route add 172.0.0.0/24 via 10.10.0.3 dev br2
